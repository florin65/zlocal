re2c is a tool for writing very fast and very flexible scanners. Unlike any
other such tool, re2c focuses on generating high efficient code for regular
expression matching. As a result this allows a much broader range of use than
any traditional lexer offers. And Last but not least re2c generates warning free
code that is equal to hand-written code in terms of size, speed and quality.
The above made the PHP team to use re2c in various places.
