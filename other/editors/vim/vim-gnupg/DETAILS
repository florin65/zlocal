cat << EOF
This script implements transparent editing of gpg encrypted files.
The filename must have a ".gpg", ".pgp" or ".asc" suffix. When opening such a
file the content is decrypted, when opening a new file the script will ask for
the recipients of the encrypted file. The file content will be encrypted to all
recipients before it is written. The script turns off viminfo and swapfile to
increase security.
